  "description": "Llajuita arrived at La Senda Verde with 8-10 months of age along with Apthapi the Tapir, which has the same age. They come from a confiscation performed by the Forestry and Environment Police (POFOMA) in Palos Blancos, North of La Paz. Both mammals are large and require a lot of space. They are also both foragers and get along well.\n\nThey lived in a small enclosure until Senda Verde was able to build a larger one for them. The new enclosure has a pool since Tapirs need to swim. For both foraging mammals Senda Verde has alfalfa growing in the enclosure. Sadly in the dry season this alfalfa dries out and runs scarce and Senda Verde has trouble staying to date with these forager's diets."
