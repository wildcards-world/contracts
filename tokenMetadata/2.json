  "description": "Apthapi arrived at La Senda Verde with 8-10 months of age along with a female deer of the same age. They came from a confiscation performed by the Forestry and Environment Police (POFOMA) in Palos Blancos, North of La Paz. The tapir is the largest mammal in South America. They are known to be the 'gardeners of the forest' because they are nutrient recyclers. They are also excellent swimmers."
