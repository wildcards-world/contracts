  "description": "Mijungla arrived December 13th to La Senda Verde to be the second jaguar to live in the animal refuge. She was picked up from a family in the town of Palos Blancos, located in a low tropical rainforest area where the Amazon meets the Andes.\n\nThe family has a cattle ranch, and one of the cowboys in the ranch had found her in a very bad state of health laying in the forest, with a wound in her head, full of skin parasites and parts of her body without skin. They picked her up and started rehabilitating her. First they fed her the wrong food, then they realised they needed to feed her meat. It wasn't until she arrived with Senda Verde that she was able to drink cat milk, for she was so small she really needed it.\n\nThe cub was partially rehabilitated by the family but still had some difficulties when she arrived at Senda Verde. She couldn't walk very well and her stomach was swollen. Just like the Andean Bear cub Tarkus that arrived around the same time Mijungla did, this Jaguar cub spent very little time with her mother, which affects them greatly both psychologically and physiologically. Senda Verde monitors very closely both cub's digestion since they could get sick since they did not get enough milk from their mothers.\n\nWhen he arrived, Mijungla was three months old and weighted 3.2 kilograms."
