  "description": "Nonhlanhla is an 11 year old female spotted hyena who lives in the forests and grasslands of central Zululand, South Africa. Though spotted hyenas can be difficult to see in this area, Nonhlanhla is a particularly great breeder in her clan having cubs regularly, meaning she is seen often at the den site nursing her young. In an area where spotted hyenas are persecuted and there is evidence for their decline, her name in Zulu, appropriately means \"luck\"."
