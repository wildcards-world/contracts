  "description": "Original Gorilla\n\nSimon, named after Simon de la Rouviere originated from the deep dark github jungle, and his code 'this artwork is always on sale' inspired this project. He is a wizard who put us on the right track. He has helped inform some of our design decisions regarding our subsequent smart contracts, and always been willing to lend some great advice or checkout a GitHub issue for us.\n\nFunds raised by Simon, one of the first wildcards, flow toward the Wild Tomorrow Fund, our first conservation partner."
