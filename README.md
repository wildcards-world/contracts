### How it works
1. Log onto our website and a grid showing all 3 advertising blocks will be displayed.

2. All 3 of these blocks will be always on sale… forever.

3. Simply click buy on the block you would like to purchase (you will need metamask and small amount of ether):

4. Set the the selling price for your block (this allows our blocks to be always for sale. If you set the selling price at say 2 ETH, you will receive 2 ETH if someone buys this block from you - making money while advertising, pretty neat right?)

5. Add a deposit in ETH to pay for owning the space. If you set the selling price at 2 ETH, you will have to pay 2 ETH per month in order to keep this ad space. (The funds generated from this project are going towards funding our wildcards project which in turn funds conservation. We got into a 6 month Paris blockchain incubator, but we need to self fund.)

6. Now you own the block congrats! If you refresh the page you will be allowed to upload a logo of your company and add your website link. Anyone who visits the webpage will now see you company displayed in that block, until someone buys that block from you, or your deposit runs out.

### Testing

`npm run chain`  
then
`truffle test`

The Gas Reporter is disable (since it is slower). Enable gas reporter in truffle config to check.

The test may sometimes fail due to split-second changes in when the test is run due to patronage incrementing per second.
Just re-run.

NOTE: It costs ~$0.12 tx fee at 5 gwei gas price & 133 usd/eth to buy. 

### Front-End

TODO

### Running 

After installing packages, main directory:

`npm run chain`  
or  
`npm run moving_chain`  

This creates a local ganache-cli instance. The latter includes auto-mining of blocks to showcase the patronage owed increasing on the front-end.

`truffle migrate`

This deploys the ERC721-artwork/nft & the Rhino.

`cd app`  
`npm run start`

### More about us

About our always for sale adspace
This project was created at the #ETHIndia2019 hackathon. The purpose of the project is two fold:

1. To generate funds for wildlife conservation. How? We created a project called wildcards.world at the #ETHCapeTown2019 hackathon to raise funds for wildlife conservation. Subsequently, we were accepted into a 6 month blockchain incubator in Paris to accelerate the developement of this platform. The funds generated from our #ETHIndia 'always for sale adspace' will provide funding for us to develop our wildcards project and hence raise funds for conservation efforts.

2. This project is a continued social experiment to understand how always for sale adspace might behave in a viral marketplace. Many of you may be familiar with the milliondollarhomepage and how this simple project sold a million pixels at a dollar each. This rather aims at scarcity and introduces a very interesting concept where each piece of marketing real estate will be always for sale, forever.

The success of this project will allow us to provide always for sale plugin marketing solutions to other companies and continue to fund the developement of wildcards - the exploration of sustainable solutions using an always for sale mechanic.
