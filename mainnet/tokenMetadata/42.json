  "description": "Original Gorilla\n\nVitalik is the first ever animal launched on wildcards and therefore often termed an OG (Original Gorilla). The wildcards project was born at the #ETHCapeTown hackathon in May 2019 where Vitalik Buterin was one of the judges. We named Vitalik the Gorilla after Vitalik as a testament to the impact and innovation Vitalik Buterin has had on the blockchain ecosystem. Vitalik, if you are reading this, start saving some animals and buy me!\n\nFunds raised by Vitalik, initially will go to Wild Tomorrow Fund; however Vitalik doesn't represent a real gorilla, and funds for Vitalik may be distributed via another allocation mechanism in the future (DAO or otherwise)."
