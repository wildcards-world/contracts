  "description": "Original Gorilla\n\nSimon, named after Simon de la Rouviere originated from the deep dark github jungle, and his code 'this artwork is always on sale' inspired this project. He is a wizard who put us on the right track. He has helped inform some of our design decisions regarding our subsequent smart contracts, and always been willing to lend some great advice or checkout a GitHub issue for us.\n\nFunds raised by Simon, initially will go to Wild Tomorrow Fund; however Simon doesn't represent a real gorilla, and funds for Simon may be distributed via another allocation mechanism in the future (DAO or otherwise).",
