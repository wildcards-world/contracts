  "description": "Aruma was the first bear to arrive at la Senda Verde and was the game-changer for them. After he arrived they knew that our mission was to shelter and rescue animals. Aruma means 'night' in Aymara language.\n\nA little boy and his dad had stumbled in the forest upon a mother bear with two cubs. The mother and one of the cubs ran away but the other cub stood there frozen. The cub was taken by the little boy and he tried to sell it in the town of Quime. The doctor in town noticed that the cub had terrible diarrhea, called the police and the bear cub was confiscated from the little boy. The doctor arrived in La Paz at 4 am, and called Animals SOS. Aruma stayed with a volunteer for 2 months while he was getting medical treatment, until he was sent to La Senda Verde in December 2007."
