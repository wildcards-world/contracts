  "description": "Pancho is a large tortoise that was rescued before he was going to be cooked. He had spent by then a long time as a pet and that can be seen by the deformations on his shell, which show mistreatment and poor feeding habits.\n\nPancho is one of the many tortoises that have similar stories and that arrive in large numbers to La Senda Verde. Tortoises are easy to catch in the rainforest and for that reason many of them are often taken to be sold as pets."
