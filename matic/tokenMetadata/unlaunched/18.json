  "description": "Ajayu was saved by the police in Cochabamba from being brutally beaten to death by a local nearby community in 2016. He arrived in La Paz and La Senda Verde took care of his treatments. He received several surgeries, one to save his left eye and one to save his jaw from a severe infection. He stopped eating for days and had to be force fed. It was a struggle to save him, but with time he got better and now weighs 100 kilograms.\n\nAs a result from this brutal story was that la Senda Verde has become more involved in trying to change legislation in Bolivia to protect this species and avoid stories like this one from happening again. They are now working alongside biologist Ximena Velez-Liendo to present a law project that will be called the Ajayu law, named after this bear. Ajayu means spirit in Aymara language."
