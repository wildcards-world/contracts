  "description": "Tarkus was found on the roadside by a trucker in a section between Sucre and Tarija where Andean bears are known to exist. A female bear got scared by the truck and ran with the two cubs. The smallest one fell a bit behind. The trucker decided to stop, capture the cub and take him to his house, where he kept him for more than two weeks. Later he called the environmental authorities in the City of Tarija to turn him in. Capturing the cub is never a good idea, it is virtually condemning him to a life in captivity for he will never be able to learn the abilities to survive in the wild his mother would have taught him. If he would have been left alone, the mother would have come back for him later.\n\nTarkus stayed in Tarija for three weeks while the formal requirements were fulfilled. National authorities advised he should be sent to La Senda Verde, where there is a place for the cub, but also the experience of raising bear cubs with appropriate diet and management. He has been placed in a 6x5x6 enclosure, just for him, and he has been getting used to the refuge and the caretakers.\n\nTarkus has adapted well to the refuge and loves to play with the ball and in the water."
