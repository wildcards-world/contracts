  "description": "Cubai is a 15 year old Jaguar that in 2017 was relocated from a private property in the Yungas region to the La Paz Zoo. The animal was in good hands, but his advanced age mixed with the cold weather and the high altitude of La Paz, were beginning to affect his health, he needed a lower place to live in.\n\nIt was then that the authorities asked Senda Verde if they could receive him. In face of the urgency they decided to do so and make him part of their family. Cubai arrived on the 20th of November and at the beginning was being kept in a small, temporary enclosure, while la senda verde gathered funds to build him a proper enclosure.\n\nLuckily he didn’t stay there for long. A few months were enough to build a brand new enclosure, with management cage, platform, pool, the whole works! The place where it’s located has a lot of trees, vegetation and is near the river. He now spends his days playing around and enjoying a space he never had before in his lifetime."
