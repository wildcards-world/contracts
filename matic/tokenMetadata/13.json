  "description": "It was a tough and trying time in Turin, Italy. A pandemic had taken over the land and the villagers were facing hardships. Unexpectedly nature was prospering, the villagers were in hiding and the flora and fauna of the region was reclaiming its land. Most unexpectedly the dragon returned, which for a long time was believed to be extinct. Glen the Dragon of Turin emerged from the Alps just North of the city. One of the last of his kind.\n\nGlen is a unique Wildcard that is named after Glen Weyl the author of Radical Markets. He was developed during the ETHTurin hackathon. The funds raised by Glen go to the conservation voted by the community. Owners of wildcards can vote using their loyalty tokens using quadratic voting to vote which conservation should receive the funds raised for that month."
