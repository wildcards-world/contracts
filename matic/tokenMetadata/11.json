  "description": "Dlala is a young male spotted hyena, currently about 13 months old. At this age he has recently grown large enough to leave the safety of his clan's den and is out exploring the world within their territory. Too young to breed, his current existence is more about learning and interacting with his new environment; in Zulu his name means \"play\"."
