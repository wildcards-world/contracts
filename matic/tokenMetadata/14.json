  "description": "Ucok is a baby sun bear who was taken way too young from his mom, and sold into wildlife trafficking. However, Darwin Animal Doctors local partner team, the Indonesian Species Conservation Program (ISCP) rescued him from the black market. Ucok is now being rehabilitated at the BKSDA - the Indonesian wildlife authority. Ucok is understandably often quite sad, because he misses his mom. But, he regularly overcomes his sadness to be an extremely curious and inquisitive boy and he loves to test his rehab team's boundaries! He is quite mischievous, which tells us he's a smart boy!"
