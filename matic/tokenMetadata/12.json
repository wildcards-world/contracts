  "description": "Isisa is a 10 year old female spotted hyena in a small clan who inhabit the rocky outcrops and low-lying mountains of Zululand. Isisa is the mother of the young male hyena Dlala and is often seen in the Tamboti tree lined drainage canyons in the area. She is an incredibly successful hunter and is often found to have brought down large nyala antelope by herself. "
