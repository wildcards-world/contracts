  "description": "Cat Stevens is a male Ocelot that was rescued by an engineer working at the San Buenaventura sugar factory. This Factory was finished in 2016 and was built in the middle of the northern Madidi forests, just outside the national park. There is no suitable land to grow sugar cane to feed this factory, so they have simply chosen to destroy the nearby primary rainforest for that. So far 1,200 hectares have been destroyed to lay way for the cane plantations, and many more are coming. Thousands of animals have seen their homes destroyed before their eyes. Cat Stevens is one of them. Clear-cutting of the forest happened so fast (two years) that these animals didn't have time to run somewhere else or fall prey to local bush-meat hunters. They simply where left there to wonder in what once was a forest.\n\nCat Stevens was a baby then seen wondering around in a empty field by one of the engineers. He had probably lost his mother and was probably going to die if he wasn't rescued by the engineer. Cat Stevens was a small cat when he arrived. He was underweight and la Senda Verde noticed he could not walk too well, but assumed it was because of age and undernourishment. After a month, he gained weight and suddenly stopped walking. He was taken to La Paz for X-ray and noticed he had an old fracture that would not heal due to decalcification. After a couple of weeks of feeding him with cat formula, he recovered and started to walk again. Cat Stevens was alone for a few months until Cat Iris arrival, a female ocelot. They where put together and get along well."
